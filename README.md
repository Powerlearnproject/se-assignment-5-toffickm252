 # 9. Debugging in VS Code: - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
#  1. Launch Configuration:
- Create a launch configuration file (.vscode/launch.json) if it doesn't exist. This file specifies how VS Code launches your program for debugging. You can often find basic templates generated by VS Code for common languages.
- Configure the launch configuration based on your programming language and environment (e.g., interpreter path, arguments).
# 2. Set Breakpoints:
- Click on the line of code where you want to pause execution during debugging. A red dot appears, indicating the breakpoint.
# 3. Start Debugging:
- Use the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D).
- Choose the appropriate launch configuration for your program.
- Click the Start Debugging button (green play icon) or use the keyboard shortcut F5 (Windows/Linux) or Fn+F5 (macOS).

# Debugging Features in VS Code:
- Breakpoints: Pause execution at specific lines of code.
- Step Over: Execute one line of code at a time.
- Step Into: Step into function calls, diving deeper into code execution.
- Step Out: Step out of a function call, returning to the caller.
- Call Stack: View the history of function calls, allowing you to navigate through code execution.
- Variables: Inspect the values of variables at breakpoints to identify potential issues.
- Console: Interact with your program's standard input and output during debugging.

  # 10. Using Source Control: - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

- Open the desired folder (your project) in VS Code.
- Go to the Source Control view (Ctrl+Shift+G or Cmd+Shift+G).
- Click the Initialize Repository button. This creates a .git folder in your project, marking it as a Git repository.
# 2. Make Commits:
- Stage changes you want to include in a commit using the Source Control view. Staged changes are highlighted.
- Type a descriptive commit message summarizing the changes you made.
- Click the Commit button (checkmark icon) to create a commit with your staged changes and message.
# 3. Push Changes to GitHub:
- Make sure you have a GitHub account and a remote repository set up for your project.
- In the Source Control view, find the Remotes section.
- If not already configured, add a remote connection to your GitHub repository using the Add Remote command.
- Once connected, use the Push button (upward arrow icon) to push your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.
